# MinecraftMapJsonVisualizer
A program to take the output of a minecraft-map-schema-creation website as JSON and make it into a readable image. For when you want an image instead of a schema to use as a guide.

Specifically designed to work with the output of https://cartographer-mc.com/.

I wanted to make some map art, but didn't have any schema mods installed or anything. So, the output of each website I went to was remarkably unhelpful to me. 

I just wanted an image with each block on it, plus something to represent Y value. So, I did it myself! 

Just take the JSON output of your map from the above website, put it into the input folder, name it "input.json", and run!
